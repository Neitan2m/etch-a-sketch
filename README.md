# etch-a-sketch
It's just a simple etch-a-sketch game
Created with HTML, CSS and Javascript 

In this project i have learned how to manipulate DOM through specific functions




The project is missing some things i wanted to add, like a specific color selector, maybe in the future i will come back here to make all of this more beautiful

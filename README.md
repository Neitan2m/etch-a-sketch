# etch-a-sketch
It's just a simple etch-a-sketch game

In this project i have learned how to manipulate DOM through specific functions

I think it should be more interactive and more beautiful, but its okay. 



The project is missing some things i wanted to add, like a specific color selector, maybe in the fuure i will come back here to make all of this more beautiful
